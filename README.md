A simple Elasticsearch cleaner based on a Python script to clean up all indices and data streams
from the Elasticsearch cluster which are older than the specified number of days.

Below you can find an example of the execution:
```
simple-elasticsearch-cleaner % python simple_elasticsearch_cleaner.py 30
Script Execution Started!
