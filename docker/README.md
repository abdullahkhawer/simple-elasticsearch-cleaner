# Simple Elasticsearch Cleaner

- Founder: [Abdullah Khawer - LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/abdullah-khawer)

# Introduction

A simple Elasticsearch cleaner based on a Python script to delete all indices and data streams from the Elasticsearch cluster which are older than the specified number of days. It is basically a curator but with the ability to delete only, removing both indices and their associated data streams.

Below you can find an example of the execution:
```
simple-elasticsearch-cleaner % python simple_elasticsearch_cleaner.py 30
Script Execution Started!
Calculating the date that was 30 day(s) ago...
Connecting to Elasticsearch...
