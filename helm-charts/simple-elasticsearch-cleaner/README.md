# Simple Elasticsearch Cleaner

# Introduction

A simple Elasticsearch cleaner based on a Python script to delete all indices and data streams from the Elasticsearch cluster which are older than the specified number of days. It is basically a curator but with the ability to delete only, removing both indices and their associated data streams.

Below you can find an example of the execution:
```
simple-elasticsearch-cleaner % python simple_elasticsearch_cleaner.py 30
Script Execution Started!
Calculating the date that was 30 day(s) ago...
Connecting to Elasticsearch...

*Note: In the actual execution, you will see the actual values instead of `__REDACTED__` values.*

# Usage Notes

This Helm chart is a way to configure and run [Simple Elasticsearch Cleaner Docker image](https://hub.docker.com/r/abdullahkhawer/simple-elasticsearch-cleaner/) as a Docker container via a cron job in a pod on a Kubernetes cluster. It will create a Helm release to create that cron job.

## Setup

The default configuration file for this chart is configured in a way that you don't need to change anything but some configurations can be changed as desired.

The chart uses a Kubernetes secret `simple-elasticsearch-cleaner-secrets` by default. You need to create this secret with the following keys:
   - `ELASTICSEARCH_HOST`
      - Description: Host of Elasticsearch cluster.
      - Example: `https://localhost`
      - Requirement: REQUIRED
   - `ELASTICSEARCH_PORT`
      - Description: Port of Elasticsearch cluster.
      - Example: `9200`
      - Requirement: REQUIRED
   - `ELASTICSEARCH_USER`
      - Description: Username of the user of the Elasticsearch cluster.
      - Example: `admin`
      - Requirement: REQUIRED
   - `ELASTICSEARCH_PASSWORD`
      - Description: Password of the user of the Elasticsearch cluster.
      - Example: `123456789`
      - Requirement: REQUIRED

## Installation, Upgrade and Uninstallation

* Clone the git repo: `git clone git@github.com:abdullahkhawer/simple-elasticsearch-cleaner.git`

* Installation: `helm install --namespace elasticsearch simple-elasticsearch-cleaner ./helm-charts/simple-elasticsearch-cleaner`

* Upgrade: `helm upgrade --namespace elasticsearch simple-elasticsearch-cleaner ./helm-charts/simple-elasticsearch-cleaner`

* Uninstallation: `helm uninstall --namespace elasticsearch simple-elasticsearch-cleaner`

*Note: You can choose your desired namespace instead of `elasticsearch`.*
