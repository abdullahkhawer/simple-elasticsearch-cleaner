# Simple Elasticsearch Cleaner

# Introduction

A simple Elasticsearch cleaner based on a Python script to delete all indices and data streams from the Elasticsearch cluster which are older than the specified number of days. It is basically a curator but with the ability to delete only, removing both indices and their associated data streams.

Below you can find an example of the execution:
```
simple-elasticsearch-cleaner % python simple_elasticsearch_cleaner.py 30
Script Execution Started!
Calculating the date that was 30 day(s) ago...
Connecting to Elasticsearch...

```

*Note: In the actual execution, you will see the actual values instead of `__REDACTED__` values.*

# Usage Notes

This Terraform module is a way to configure and run [Simple Elasticsearch Cleaner Docker image](https://hub.docker.com/r/abdullahkhawer/simple-elasticsearch-cleaner/) as a Docker container via a cron job in a pod on a Kubernetes cluster. It will use its Helm chart to create a Helm release to create that cron job.

## Setup

The default configuration file for the Helm chart is configured in a way that you don't need to change anything but some configurations can be changed as desired.

Similarly, Terraform variables have default values and you don't need to change anything but you can set the desired values.

The Helm chart uses a Kubernetes secret `simple-elasticsearch-cleaner-secrets` by default. You need to create this secret with the following keys:
   - `ELASTICSEARCH_HOST`
      - Description: Host of Elasticsearch cluster.
      - Example: `https://localhost`
      - Requirement: REQUIRED
   - `ELASTICSEARCH_PORT`
      - Description: Port of Elasticsearch cluster.
      - Example: `9200`
      - Requirement: REQUIRED
   - `ELASTICSEARCH_USER`
      - Description: Username of the user of the Elasticsearch cluster.
      - Example: `admin`
      - Requirement: REQUIRED
   - `ELASTICSEARCH_PASSWORD`
      - Description: Password of the user of the Elasticsearch cluster.
      - Example: `123456789`
      - Requirement: REQUIRED

## Installation

You can deploy this Terraform module as follows:

```hcl
module "simple-elasticsearch-cleaner" {
  source = "git::ssh://git@github.com:abdullahkhawer/simple-elasticsearch-cleaner.git?ref=master"

  # Following variables are optional
  image_tag                 = var.image_tag
  image_pull_policy         = var.image_pull_policy
  namespace                 = var.namespace
  schedule                  = var.schedule
  number_of_days            = var.number_of_days
  resources_limits_cpu      = var.resources_limits_cpu
  resources_limits_memory   = var.resources_limits_memory
  resources_requests_cpu    = var.resources_requests_cpu
  resources_requests_memory = var.resources_requests_memory
  node_selector             = var.node_selector
}
```
